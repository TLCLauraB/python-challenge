# Homework Repo for Challenge 3

## Author: Laura Bishop

## Overview

I received help and support from my fellow Data Vis classmates via our Discord Server (both through voice chat and text), as well as our class-provided Slack Channel.

I used the Python code as per the module and utilized Pandas as a functions library. I debugged using Jupyter Notebooks but converted the files back over to Python to ensure compliance with the homework assignment.

You may also notice several commented-out function calls that I labeled 'Test for Success'. These were milestone tests for me to make sure the functions I was calling were actually performing as desired before incorporating into the whole.

I utilized the following websites:
